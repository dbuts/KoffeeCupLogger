# KoffeeCup Logger
## Why?
An estimated 250 **billion** single-use paper cups are used a year. Most of these cups are unrecycleable due to a pastic coating on the inside that can't be seperated from the paper. This program hopes to provide a reusable mug checkout system for coffee shops hoping to reduce their environmental footprint.
## The System
This system works by having an RFID tag attached to the bottom of resuable mugs. By scanning the bottom of the mug at time of checkout, the user's information is attached and stored in a yaml file containing: mug's tag, drinker's name, location of checkout, date, and card information.

If after 2 weeks the user has not returned the mug their card will be charged the price of the mug.
